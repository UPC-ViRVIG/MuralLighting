# Image Difference

## Difference
- [ ] Superimpose one of the original images?
- [ ] Detect geometry changes (using depth maps or other means)
- [x] Adjust max difference value (+ change max computation)
- [x] Change the shader to show the difference as a diverging color map (such as seismic or bwr)

## Dialog
- [ ] Control pannels should be collapsed when the dialog opens, and extended when the dialog closes. Changes TBD in client.js
- [ ] Aspect ratio of the dialog does not change dynamically (either initially) to take into account texture's aspect ratio
- [ ] Make it responsive -> if window changes size's of dialog and canvas are incorrect
- [ ] See how to integrate it with the main UI


# UI

- [ ] Add image selection
- [x] Reorganize GUI
